Dephokey â€” PasswordManager v.1.0.0 is an application that stores sensitive data under an encryption key within its own 
database. It avoids connecting to third-party servers, keeping all data and its credentials under the user's control, 
thus respecting their privacy.

## Installation Guide
First ensure you have Python v.3.11.5 or later, Git v.2.45.1 or later and Docker v28.0.1 or later 
installed on your computer (note: Docker **is not essential** for this app, it just allows you to work with emails). 
You can download them from these URLs:

)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-Download-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=white

### ðŸ”¹ Create a folder
Open your favorite IDE, create a new folder and navigate into it
```
# Creates folder
mkdir <new_folder>

# Navigate into it
cd <new_folder>
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Clone the repository
Once you are inside your new folder, you can clone this repo with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ildiar25/dephokey
```
This creates a new folder named `dephokey`. Navigate into it with the command `cd dephokey`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Create a virtual environment
Now, you need a new virtual environment. To create a new one, please follow the steps below:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Once it is created, activate it with the following instructions:

**From PowerShell:**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**From CMD:**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

*__ATTENTION:__ When you try to activate it you can get the following message:*
```
+ .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
```

That's because Windows has script execution disabled by default. \
You can solve this problem by opening Windows PowerShell in Administrator Mode and running the following command. Then 
answer _'yes'_:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Now, you can activate the virtual environment.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Install Dependencies
This app needs some dependencies, and you can install them automatically by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Start Email Server
This command opens port 1025 on localhost in detached mode (make sure Docker is running before)
```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Run Tests
Before using the app, you will need to check if all features are working correctly. To do that, you must run 
the python tests with the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Run the app
Now, your app is ready to run. Enjoy it!
```bash
flet run app.py
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Stop the server
Once you are finished, you can stop the server with the following command:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```
